* Multi node Kubernetes Cluster

This a multi node cluster playground which offers a production-like environment using Vagrant and Ansible for provisioning the cluster on multiple providers such as Docker, VirtualBox, KVM/libvirt, Docker, and so on.
By using Ansible as the infrastructure automation engine we can have playbooks written in yaml that offer inventory management the infrastructure-as-code way.

* Requirements

- Vagrant: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
- Ansible: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html
- VirtualBox, KVM/libvirt or Docker as the provider.

* Quick reference

After pulling this repository run `vagrant up` on the base folder.
When the cluster is up and running you can ssh and
can use `kubectl` on the master:

#+BEGIN_SRC
 $ vagrant ssh k8s-master
 $ kubectl get nodes
 NAME         STATUS     ROLES    AGE     VERSION
 k8s-master   Ready      master   4m28s   v1.19.0
 node-1       Ready      <none>   2m12s   v1.19.0
 node-2       NotReady   <none>   1s      v1.19.0
#+END_SRC


Or if you have `kubectl` installed locally, try:

#+BEGIN_SRC
 $ kubectl --kubeconfig=.kube/config get nodes
 NAME         STATUS     ROLES    AGE     VERSION
 k8s-master   Ready      master   4m28s   v1.19.0
 node-1       Ready      <none>   2m12s   v1.19.0
 node-2       NotReady   <none>   1s      v1.19.0
#+END_SRC
